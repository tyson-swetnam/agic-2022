Zarr dependes on [NumPy](https://numpy.org/){target=_blank}
 and can save data from NumPy arrays. When paired with [Dask](https://www.dask.org/){target=_blank}
, Zarr's parallel processing and file transfers increases the read/write speed of your NumPy array data.

The power of Zarr is most easily explained when working with it on the cloud.
